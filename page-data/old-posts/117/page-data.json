It would help a lot if you could write a program to automate the admission procedure.</p>\n<p>Each applicant will have to provide two grades: the national entrance exam grade GE, and the interview grade GI. The final grade of an applicant is (GE + GI) / 2. The admission rules are:</p>\n<p>The applicants are ranked according to their final grades, and will be admitted one by one from the top of the rank list.\nIf there is a tied final grade, the applicants will be ranked according to their national entrance exam grade GE. If still tied, their ranks must be the same.\nEach applicant may have K choices and the admission will be done according to his/her choices: if according to the rank list, it is one’s turn to be admitted; and if the quota of one’s most preferred shcool is not exceeded, then one will be admitted to this school, or one’s other choices will be considered one by one in order. If one gets rejected by all of preferred schools, then this unfortunate applicant will be rejected.\nIf there is a tied rank, and if the corresponding applicants are applying to the same school, then that school must admit all the applicants with the same rank, even if its quota will be exceeded.\nInput Specification:</p>\n<p>Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing three positive integers: N (&#x3C;=40,000), the total number of applicants; M (&#x3C;=100), the total number of graduate schools; and K (&#x3C;=5), the number of choices an applicant may have.</p>\n<p>In the next line, separated by a space, there are M positive integers. The i-th integer is the quota of the i-th graduate school respectively.</p>\n<p>Then N lines follow, each contains 2+K integers separated by a space. The first 2 integers are the applicant’s GE and GI, respectively. The next K integers represent the preferred schools. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the schools are numbered from 0 to M-1, and the applicants are numbered from 0 to N-1.</p>\n<p>Output Specification:</p>\n<p>For each test case you should output the admission results for all the graduate schools. The results of each school must occupy a line, which contains the applicants’ numbers that school admits. The numbers must be in increasing order and be separated by a space. There must be no extra space at the end of each line. If no applicant is admitted by a school, you must output an empty line correspondingly.</p>\n<p>Sample Input:\n11 6 3\n2 1 2 2 2 3\n100 100 0 1 2\n60 60 2 3 5\n100 90 0 3 4\n90 100 1 2 0\n90 90 5 1 3\n80 90 1 0 2\n80 80 0 1 2\n80 80 0 1 2\n80 70 1 3 2\n70 80 1 2 3\n100 100 0 2 4\nSample Output:\n0 10\n3\n5 6 7\n2 8</p>\n<p>1 4</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">    #include \"stdio.h\"\n    //#include \"math.h\"\n    #include \"string.h\"\n    #include \"algorithm\"\n    using namespace std;\n    struct student{\n        int stuid, ge, gi, sum;\n        int choice[6];//录取意向\n        int rank;//排名\n    }stu[40010];\n    struct school{\n        int quota;\n        int stuNum;\n        int id[40010];//招收学生的学号\n        int lastAdmit;\n    }sch[110];\n    int n,m,k;\n    bool cmp(student a, student b){\n        if (a.sum != b.sum) {\n            return a.sum > b.sum;\n        }else{\n            return a.ge > b.ge;\n        }\n    }\n    bool cmpid(int a, int b){\n        return stu[a].stuid &lt; stu[b].stuid;\n    }\n    int main(){\n        scanf(\"%d%d%d\", &amp;n, &amp;m, &amp;k);\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; m; i++) {\n            scanf(\"%d\", &amp;sch[i].quota);\n            sch[i].stuNum = 0;\n            sch[i].lastAdmit = -1;\n        }\n        for (int i = 0 ; i &lt; n; i++) {\n            scanf(\"%d%d\", &amp;stu[i].ge, &amp;stu[i].gi);\n            stu[i].stuid = i;\n            stu[i].sum = stu[i].gi + stu[i].ge;\n            for (int j = 0; j &lt; k; j++) {\n                scanf(\"%d\", &amp;stu[i].choice[j]);\n            }\n        }\n        sort(stu, stu + n, cmp);\n        //进行排名\n        stu[0].rank = 1;\n        for (int r = 1; r &lt; n; r++) {\n            if (stu[r].sum == stu[r - 1].sum &amp;&amp; stu[r].ge == stu[r - 1].ge) {\n                //相同排名\n                stu[r].rank = stu[r - 1].rank;\n            }else{\n                stu[r].rank = r + 1;\n            }\n        }\n        //分配学校\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; n; i++) {\n            //对每个学生判断被哪个学校录取\n            for (int j = 0 ; j &lt; k; j++) {\n                int choice = stu[i].choice[j];\n                int num = sch[choice].stuNum;//学校的当前招生人数\n                int last = sch[choice].lastAdmit;//最后一个录取的学生的学号\n                if (num &lt; sch[choice].quota || (last != -1 &amp;&amp; stu[i].rank == stu[last].rank)) {\n                    //还有名额剩余或者前一个同学和后一个同学排名相同\n                    sch[choice].id[num] = i;//记录该考生\n                    sch[choice].lastAdmit = i;\n                    sch[choice].stuNum++;//当前招生人数+1\n                    break;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        for (int i = 0; i &lt; m; i++) {\n            if (sch[i].stuNum > 0) {//招到了学生\n                sort(sch[i].id, sch[i].id + sch[i].stuNum, cmpid);//按id排序\n                for (int j = 0; j &lt; sch[i].stuNum; j++) {\n                    printf(\"%d\",stu[sch[i].id[j]].stuid);\n                    if (j &lt; sch[i].stuNum - 1) {\n                        printf(\" \");\n                    }\n                }\n            }\n            printf(\"\\n\");\n        }\n        return 0;\n    }</code></pre></div>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"PAT A1080","date":"February 09, 2017","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/old-posts/116/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"PAT A1083"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/old-posts/118/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"PAT B1029/A1084"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"aa6e2bf7-c6e6-50c6-8443-57faa13c0a3e","previousPostId":"31421d2d-4631-55f4-b0cf-92140515e672","nextPostId":"c6d0acaf-367d-5019-8fca-8a349f483a48"}},
