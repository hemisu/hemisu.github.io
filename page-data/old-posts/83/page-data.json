For example, 1234321 is a palindromic number. All single digit numbers are palindromic numbers.</p>\n<p>Although palindromic numbers are most often considered in the decimal system, the concept of palindromicity can be applied to the natural numbers in any numeral system. Consider a number N > 0 in base b >= 2, where it is written in standard notation with k+1 digits ai as the sum of (aibi) for i from 0 to k. Here, as usual, 0 &#x3C;= ai &#x3C; b for all i and ak is non-zero. Then N is palindromic if and only if ai = ak-i for all i. Zero is written 0 in any base and is also palindromic by definition.</p>\n<p>Given any non-negative decimal integer N and a base b, you are supposed to tell if N is a palindromic number in base b.</p>\n<p>Input Specification:</p>\n<p>Each input file contains one test case. Each case consists of two non-negative numbers N and b, where 0 &#x3C;= N &#x3C;= 109 is the decimal number and 2 &#x3C;= b &#x3C;= 109 is the base. The numbers are separated by a space.</p>\n<p>Output Specification:</p>\n<p>For each test case, first print in one line “Yes” if N is a palindromic number in base b, or “No” if not. Then in the next line, print N as the number in base b in the form “ak ak-1 … a0”. Notice that there must be no extra space at the end of output.</p>\n<p>Sample Input 1:\n27 2\nSample Output 1:\nYes\n1 1 0 1 1\nSample Input 2:\n121 5\nSample Output 2:\nNo\n4 4 1</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">#include \"stdio.h\"\n//#include \"math.h\"\n//#include \"string.h\"\n//#include \"algorithm\"\n//using namespace std;\nint main(){\n    int n,b,top = -1;\n    int ans[31];\n    scanf(\"%d%d\", &amp;n, &amp;b);\n    do{\n        ans[++top] = n % b;\n        n /= b;\n    }while(n != 0);\n    int i,j;\n    for (i = 0,j = top ; i &lt; j; i++,j--) {\n        if(ans[i] != ans[j])break;\n    }\n    if (i >= j) {\n        printf(\"Yes\\n\");\n    }else{\n        printf(\"No\\n\");\n    }//判断palindromic数\n    while (top > -1) {\n        printf(\"%d\",ans[top]);\n        if (top--) {\n            printf(\" \");\n        }\n    }\n    return 0;\n}</code></pre></div>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"PAT A1019","date":"February 04, 2017","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/old-posts/82/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"PAT B1037"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/old-posts/84/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"PAT A1027"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"1c8fd6f9-1ad2-52a5-8765-0af24066b7dd","previousPostId":"938cf474-3c21-58e2-8133-6048e8348fc0","nextPostId":"c8f5bb90-b380-533c-9ca7-45d59647acd2"}},
