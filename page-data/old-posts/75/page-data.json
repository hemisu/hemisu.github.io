Similarly, football betting fans were putting their money where their mouths were, by laying all manner of World Cup bets.</p>\n<p>Chinese Football Lottery provided a “Triple Winning” game. The rule of winning was simple: first select any three of the games. Then for each selected game, bet on one of the three possible results — namely W for win, T for tie, and L for lose. There was an odd assigned to each result. The winner’s odd would be the product of the three odds times 65%.</p>\n<p>For example, 3 games’ odds are given as the following:</p>\n<p>W    T    L\n1.1  2.5  1.7\n1.2  3.0  1.6\n4.1  1.2  1.1\nTo obtain the maximum profit, one must buy W for the 3rd game, T for the 2nd game, and T for the 1st game. If each bet takes 2 yuans, then the maximum profit would be (4.1<em>3.0</em>2.5*65%-1)*2 = 37.98 yuans (accurate up to 2 decimal places).</p>\n<p>Input</p>\n<p>Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains the betting information of 3 games. Each game occupies a line with three distinct odds corresponding to W, T and L.</p>\n<p>Output</p>\n<p>For each test case, print in one line the best bet of each game, and the maximum profit accurate up to 2 decimal places. The characters and the number must be separated by one space.</p>\n<p>Sample Input\n1.1 2.5 1.7\n1.2 3.0 1.6\n4.1 1.2 1.1\nSample Output\nT T W 37.98</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">#include \"stdio.h\"\n//#include \"algorithm\"\n//using namespace std;\nchar s[3] = {'W','T','L'};\nint main(){\n    double ans = 1.0, tmp, a;\n    int idmax = 0;\n    for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; i++) {\n        tmp = 0.0;\n        for (int j =0; j &lt; 3; j++) {\n            scanf(\"%lf\", &amp;a);\n            if (a > tmp) {\n                tmp = a;\n                idmax = j;\n            }\n\n        }\n        ans *= tmp;\n        printf(\"%c \",s[idmax]);\n    }\n//    printf(\"%.2f\", (int) (((ans * 0.65 -1 ) * 2)*1000+0.5)/1000.0);\n    printf(\"%.2f\", (ans * 0.65-1)*2);\n    return 0;\n}</code></pre></div>\n<p>收获：\n可以看到输出的时候的备注，保留两位小数是没有四舍五入的，样例给的37.98是四舍五入后的答案，而不四舍五入答案也正确，不明白其中原因。\nmap的使用</p>","tableOfContents":"","frontmatter":{"title":"PAT A1011","date":"February 02, 2017","description":null}},"previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/old-posts/74/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"PAT B1032"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/old-posts/76/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"PAT A1006"}}},"pageContext":{"id":"d87d255c-34ee-556b-88ff-0428da8587bc","previousPostId":"1aa81a88-e1cf-5afe-a659-4a315cf3c7b1","nextPostId":"2964d9da-6834-5b33-af88-7bac2143161d"}},
