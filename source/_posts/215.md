A Binary Search Tree (BST) is recursively defined as a binary tree which has the following properties:

The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.
Given the structure of a binary tree and a sequence of distinct integer keys, there is only one way to fill these keys into the tree so that the resulting tree satisfies the definition of a BST. You are supposed to output the level order traversal sequence of that tree. The sample is illustrated by Figure 1 and 2.


Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives a positive integer N (<=100) which is the total number of nodes in the tree. The next N lines each contains the left and the right children of a node in the format "left_index right_index", provided that the nodes are numbered from 0 to N-1, and 0 is always the root. If one child is missing, then -1 will represent the NULL child pointer. Finally N distinct integer keys are given in the last line.

Output Specification:

For each test case, print in one line the level order traversal sequence of that tree. All the numbers must be separated by a space, with no extra space at the end of the line.

Sample Input:
9
1 6
2 3
-1 -1
-1 4
5 -1
-1 -1
7 -1
-1 8
-1 -1
73 45 11 58 82 25 67 38 42
Sample Output:
58 25 82 11 38 67 45 73 42
