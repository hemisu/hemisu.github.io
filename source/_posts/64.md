The task is really simple: given N exits on a highway which forms a simple cycle, you are supposed to tell the shortest distance between any pair of exits.

Input Specification:

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains an integer N (in [3, 105]), followed by N integer distances D1 D2 ... DN, where Di is the distance between the i-th and the (i+1)-st exits, and DN is between the N-th and the 1st exits. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space. The second line gives a positive integer M (<=104), with M lines follow, each contains a pair of exit numbers, provided that the exits are numbered from 1 to N. It is guaranteed that the total round trip distance is no more than 107.

Output Specification:

For each test case, print your results in M lines, each contains the shortest distance between the corresponding given pair of exits.

Sample Input:
5 1 2 4 14 9
3
1 3
2 5
4 1
Sample Output:
3

    #include "stdio.h"
    int main(){
        int arr[100001],ans[100001];
        int n,m;
        int left,right;
        int x,y;
        scanf("%d",&n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            scanf("%d",&arr[i]);//读入数组
        }
        scanf("%d",&m);
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            left = right = 0;//初始化
            scanf("%d %d", &x, &y);
            for (int i = ((x - 1 + n) % n);;) {//顺时针
                right += arr[i];
                i = ((i + 1 + n) % n);
                if (i == ((y - 1 + n) % n)) {
                    break;
                }
            }
            for (int i = ((x - 2 + n) % n);;) {//逆时针
                left += arr[i];
                i = ((i - 1 + n) % n);
                if (i == ((y - 2 + n) % n)) {
                break;
                }
            }
            ans[j] = (left > right)?right:left;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            printf("%d\n", ans[j]);
        }
        return 0;
    }

这部分代码时间超时了，所以需要预处理一下。

    #include "stdio.h"
    #include "algorithm"
    using namespace std;
    int dis[100001],A[100001];
    int main(){
        int sum = 0, query, n, left, right;
        scanf("%d",&n);
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            scanf("%d", &A[i]);
            sum += A[i];
            dis[i] = sum;
        }
        scanf("%d", &query);
        for (int i = 0; i < query; i++) {
            scanf("%d%d", &left, &right);
            if (left > right) {
                swap(left, right);
            }
            int temp = dis[right - 1] - dis[left - 1];
            printf("%d\n", min(temp, sum - temp));
        }
        return 0;
    }
