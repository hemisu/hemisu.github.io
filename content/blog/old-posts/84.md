People in Mars represent the colors in their computers in a similar way as the Earth people. That is, a color is represented by a 6-digit number, where the first 2 digits are for Red, the middle 2 digits for Green, and the last 2 digits for Blue. The only difference is that they use radix 13 (0-9 and A-C) instead of 16. Now given a color in three decimal numbers (each between 0 and 168), you are supposed to output their Mars RGB values.

Input

Each input file contains one test case which occupies a line containing the three decimal color values.

Output

For each test case you should output the Mars RGB value in the following format: first output "#", then followed by a 6-digit number where all the English characters must be upper-cased. If a single color is only 1-digit long, you must print a "0" to the left.

Sample Input
15 43 71
Sample Output
#123456

    #include "stdio.h"
    char redix[13] = {'0', '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', '9', 'A', 'B', 'C'};
    int main(){
        int a, b, c;
        scanf("%d %d %d", &a, &b, &c);
        printf("#");
        printf("%c%c",redix[a/13],redix[a%13]);
        printf("%c%c",redix[b/13],redix[b%13]);
        printf("%c%c",redix[c/13],redix[c%13]);
        return 0;
    }
