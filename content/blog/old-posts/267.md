John got a full mark on PAT. He was so happy that he decided to hold a raffle（抽奖） for his followers on Weibo -- that is, he would select winners from every N followers who forwarded his post, and give away gifts. Now you are supposed to help him generate the list of winners.

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line gives three positive integers M (<= 1000), N and S, being the total number of forwards, the skip number of winners, and the index of the first winner (the indices start from 1). Then M lines follow, each gives the nickname (a nonempty string of no more than 20 characters, with no white space or return) of a follower who has forwarded John's post.

Note: it is possible that someone would forward more than once, but no one can win more than once. Hence if the current candidate of a winner has won before, we must skip him/her and consider the next one.

**Output Specification:**

For each case, print the list of winners in the same order as in the input, each nickname occupies a line. If there is no winner yet, print "Keep going..." instead.

**Sample Input 1:**
9 3 2

      scanf("%d%d%d", &m, &n, &s);
      str.resize(m);
      if(s>m){ printf("Keep going...\n"); return 0;}
      for (int i = 0; i < m; i++){
        cin>>str[i];
      }
      int t = s - 1;
      while(t < m){
        if(mp[str[t]] != 1){
          mp[str[t]] = 1;
          cout<<str[t]<<endl;
          t+= n;
        }else{
          t++;  
        }         
      }
